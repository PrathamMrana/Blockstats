    <p>Lord Krishna beautifully explained the concept “Action in inaction and inaction in action”. When Lord Krishna says just perform your duty sincerely without expectation of its fruit. What does it mean?</p>

<p>Psychologically, If we take a look with sentience, when we work on any project/task/activity and we are constantly focusing on result, it brings anxiety and a kind of unwanted pressure which affects the efficiency and creativity, increases stress, affecting relationships in many cases, affecting the whole activity which could have been done easily if the whole focus is put on the work without constantly thinking about the result. Lord Krishna wants us to get engrossed in everything we do instead of focusing on the result with halfhearted action. When one focuses on the result with lot of expectations in his/her favor and if the result goes out of the plan, then it makes the person frustrated, depressed and develops the mindset not to take risks in future. For example; this badly affects the performance of the students when they just focus on result rather than putting 100% effort in studies causing distress</p></div>
